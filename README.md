# SoluteDensity
This python code is useful for calculating solute density over Molecular Dynamics Simulation trajectories
First let's discuss what this code actually do ?
you have to provide the topology file and your trajectory file , so here i am using MDAnalysis library so it can understand mostof file extensions of different softwares.
For applying this code for your system replace following things:
1. Topology File, Trajectory File
2. choose your own selection of which you have to find the density
3. you can adjust other parameters for plots like xlabel ylabel color of heat map and names of files
